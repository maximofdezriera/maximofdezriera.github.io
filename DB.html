                    </li>
                    <li>Can be at many different levels, from high–level corporate goals down to descriptions of small

                    <li>UML provides class diagrams that are a useful way of representing this information

                    <li>
                        Each class can be considered a template for storing data about a set of similar things (places,

                    </li>
                    <li>These pieces of information, that we will keep about each plant, are referred to as the

                    </li>
                    <li>In a database, we would usually create a table for each class, and the information about each
                        object would be recorded as a row in that table
                    </li>
                    <li>The information about the specific relationship instances
                        would also be recorded in a table.

                <ul>
                    <li>In UML, a relationship is represented by a line between two class rectangles</li>
                    <li>The pair of numbers at each end of the line indicates how many objects of one
                        class can be associated with a particular object of the other class
                    </li>
                    <li>The first number is the minimum number. This
                        is usually 0 or 1 and is therefore sometimes known as the <u>optionality</u></li>
                    <li>The second number is the greatest number of related objects. It is usually 1 or many (denoted
                        n), although other numbers are possible
                    </li>
                    <li>Collectively, these numbers can be referred to as the <u>cardinality</u> or the
                        <u>multiplicity</u> of the relationship.

                <ul>
                    <li>Relationships are read in both directions. Figure 2-9 shows how many objects of the right–hand
                        class can
                        be associated with one particular object of the left–hand class and vice versa.
                    </li>
                    <li>When we want to know how many
                        objects of ClassB are associated with ClassA, we look at the numbers nearest ClassB.

                <h2>Common problems</h2>

                <p>Answers such as “No, not really,” or “Hardly
                    ever,” or “Umm, no, I don’t think so, umm, well maybe,” are a sign that a complication exists that
                    needs to be
                    understood before any design of a database should proceed further.</p>

                    determine the
                    input and output requirements (both immediate and potential).</p>

                <h2>Normalization</h2>

                <div>Process of database normalization in which relations (tables) created from the conversion of the
                    E-R model
                    are
                    analyzed for potential flaws (anomalies) and these flaws are corrected.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Normalization is a process in which we systematically examine relations for anomalies and,
                            when
                            detected, remove those anomalies by splitting up the relation into two new, related,
                            relations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Normalization is an important part of the database development process: Often during
                            normalization,
                            the
                            database designers get their first real look into how the data are going to interact in the
                            database.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finding problems with the database structure at this stage is strongly preferred to finding
                            problems
                            further along in the development process because at this point it is fairly easy to cycle
                            back to
                            the
                            conceptual model (Entity Relationship model) and make changes.

                        <li>
                            Normalization can also be thought of as a trade-off between data redundancy and performance.
                            Normalizing
                            a relation reduces data redundancy but introduces the need for joins when all of the data is
                            required by
                            an application such as a report query.

                            <li><b>1 .. 1 Relation:</b><br>
                                Maybe you should consider your representation model because MAYBE those tables could be
                                only
                                one
                            </li>
                            <li><b>0,1 .. N Relation:</b><br>
                                You'll create a new field in your relation ship, usign a foreign key in entity with
                                cardinallity 0,1 as a field optional or no with a foreign key linking to N entity
                            </li>
                            <li><b>N .. M Relation:</b><br>
                                A new table will be created using each entity as a foreign key inside an unique index.
                                Avoid using multiple primary keys for that new table. Usually it's a better pattern
                                using a new
                                autoincrement primary key with other foreign key attributes as an unique index

                        You want to create a small social website for students and teachers in a different way:
                        <br>
                        Teachers share with others teachers their lessons to discuss and create a better feedback. So,
                        your school wants you to create a database which allows the following concepts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Every group can have different teachers. And all teachers are available to manage only
                                their groups
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Teachers create events for every lesson they want to discuss, so they could set an
                                specific date and work on it. Every event or class should ensure student's group, and
                                related course
                            </li>
                            <li>In every created lesson, all associted teachers can improve the contents or task to be

                            <li>When some teacher makes a change, the system should send a message to the other

                                An attribute is functionally dependent on another if we can use the value of one
                                attribute to
                                determine the value of another.

                                Example: Employee_Name is functionally dependent on Social_Security_Number because
                                Social_Security_Number can be used to uniquely determine the value of Employee_Name.

                            <ul>

                        </div>
                        <div>
                            These aspects of the business rule very much ought to get enforced by the database and
                            design.
                            Even if the substance of the rule is implemented in the business layer, you are still going
                            to
                            have a table in the database that records the size of the discount, the date it was offered,
                            the
                            ID of the person who approved it, and so on. On the Discount column, you should have a CHECK
                            constraint that restricts the values allowed in this column to between 0.00 and 0.90 (or
                            whatever the maximum is).

                                is probably the largest draw. When code that accesses the database is compiled into a
                                different layer, performance tweaks cannot be made without a functional programmer's
                                involvement. Stored procedures give the database professional the power to change
                                characteristics of the database code without additional resource involvement, making
                                small changes, or large upgrades (for example changes to SQL syntax) easier to do.

                                you need to make to the database so that the knock on effect on user interfaces is
                                minimized. For example, say you originally modeled one phone number, but now want an
                                unlimited number of phone numbers. You could leave the single phone number in the
                                procedure call, but store it in a different table as a stopgap measure, or even
                                permanently if you have a "primary" number of some sort that you always want to display.
                                Then a stored proc could be built to handle the other phone numbers. In this manner the
                                impact to the user interfaces could be quite small, while the code of stored procedures
                                might change greatly.

                                There are a couple of reasons that I believe stored procedures enhance performance.
                                First, if a newbie writes ratty code (like using a cursor to go row by row through an
                                entire ten million row table to find one value, instead of using a WHERE clause), the
                                procedure can be rewritten without impact to the system (other than giving back valuable
                                resources.)

                <small>
                    <div>About dynamic SQL procedures. Dynamic SQL is a great tool to use when you have procedures that
                        are not optimizable / manageable otherwise. A good example is a search procedure with many
                        different choices. A precompiled solution with multiple OR conditions might have to take a worst
                        case scenario approach to the plan and yield weak results, especially if parameter usage is
                        sporadic.

                        However, the main point of this tip is that you should avoid coding very generic objects, such
                        as ones that take a table name and twenty column names/value pairs as a parameter and lets you
                        update the values in the table. For example, you could write a procedure that started out:
                    </div>
                    <pre>                            CREATE PROCEDURE updateAnyTable

                <small>
                    <div>Let’s allow users to make comments on bugs. A given bug may have
                        many comments, but any given comment must pertain to a single bug.
                        So, there’s a one-to-many relationship between Bugs and Comments. However, you might have two
                        tables you can comment on. Bugs and FeatureRequests
                        are similar entities, although you might store them as separate
                        tables.
                        You’d like to store Comments in a single table regardless of whether they
                        pertain to either type of issue—a bug or a feature—but you can’t declare
                        a foreign key that references multiple parent tables

                            this example, the new column is called issue_type, and it contains either
                            Bugs or FeatureRequests, corresponding to the names of the two possible

                            the base table. You don’t need an issue_type column.

                                    makes some tasks easier, but usually at the cost of other tasks
                                    that become harder.

                                <li>Relocating a single node or a subtree is also easy:<pre>UPDATE Comments SET parent_id = 3 WHERE comment_id = 6;

                                <li>However, deleting a node from a tree is more complex. If you want to
                                    delete an entire subtree, you have to issue multiple queries to find all
                                    descendants. Then remove the descendants from the lowest level up to

                                    many developers yet it fails to be a solution for one of the most common
                                    tasks you need to do with a tree: query all descendants
                                </li>
                                <li>However, this queries only two levels of the tree. One characteristic of a
                                    tree is that it can extend to any depth, so you need to be able to query
                                    the descendents without regard to the number of levels. For example,
                                    you may need to compute the COUNT( ) of comments in the thread or
                                    the SUM( ) of the cost of parts in a mechanical assembly.

                        <div class="col-md-6">One weakness of Adjacency List is that it’s expensive to retrieve
                            ancestors
                            of a given node in the tree. In Path Enumeration, this is solved by
                            storing the string of ancestors as an attribute of each node.<br>
                            You can see a form of Path Enumeration in directory hierarchies. A
                            UNIX path like /usr/local/lib/ is a Path Enumeration of the filesystem,
                            where usr is the parent of local, which in turn is the parent of lib.
                            In the Comments table, instead of the parent_id column, define a column
                            called path as a long VARCHAR. The string stored in this column is the
                            sequence of ancestors of the current row in order from the top of the
                            tree down

                            to the set of its descendants, rather than the node’s immediate
                            parent. This information can be represented by encoding each node in
                            the tree with two numbers, which you can call nsleft and nsright.<br>
                            Each node is given nsleft and nsright numbers in the following way:
                            the nsleft number is less than the numbers of all the node’s children,
                            whereas the nsright number is greater than the numbers of all the node’s
                            children. These numbers have no relation to the comment_id values.<br>
                            An easy way to assign these values is by following a depth-first traversal
                            of the tree, assigning nsleft numbers incrementally as you descend a
                            branch of the tree and assigning nsright numbers as you ascend back
                            up the branch.<br>Once you have assigned each node with these numbers, you can use
                            them to find ancestors and descendants of any given node. For example,
                            you can retrieve comment #4 and its descendants by searching for
                            nodes whose numbers are between the current node’s nsleft and nsright.

                            It involves storing all paths through the tree, not just those
                            with a direct parent-child relationship.
                            In addition to a plain Comments table, create another table TreePaths,
                            with two columns, each of which is a foreign key to the Comments table.<br><br>
                            Instead of using the Comments table to store information about the tree
                            structure, use the TreePaths table. Store one row in this table for each
                            pair of nodes in the tree that shares an ancestor/descendant relationship,
                            even if they are separated by multiple levels in the tree. Also add
                            a row for each node to reference itself.
